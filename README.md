# RSS News Spreeder
A spreeder for the Pebble Smartwatch.

# How to use
When you first get the app, there's a list of 8 rss feeds from an assortment of news sources. 

# Customize Feeds
To customize your feeds, open your pebble app on your smartphone and press the gear icon. There, any changes you make to the feeds will be reflected.

For example, you can press 'remove' for all of the feeds and then press 'add feed' and add one for Quora by typing 'Quora' into the Title field and pasting in the url 'http://www.quora.com/rss' in the Url field.

Afterwards, press confirm (or cancel if you change your mind), exit out of the pebble app, launch it again, and your feeds should be updated!
